Netlify Deploy Status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a1565f2d-8f83-4c9d-ac86-c0f68660641b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/madicetea/deploys)

Site URL: https://madicetea.me

The site was built from my University campus in Tokyo as a part of a self-driven project.

As with most of my hack projects, I choose something that would be of use to my near-future - as I would had soon started my job-searching, I decided to make a website to introduce myself. It currently serves as a contact point and a personal homepage.

(1st Writing) I have finished setting my DNS for both www and non-www, and for the ME and COM TLDs. (DONE)

(2nd writing) The webpage had undergone some changes in the backend to implement Forestry CMS blog integration (after a failed attempt at Netlify's native CMS)\*. Other changes included hardening the website headers and integrating some custom version upgrades to third-party libraries to resolve GitHub ack'd CVE security notifications.

\* It is quite possible that recent changes from the upstream template have made all headless CMS integartions (including Forestry, NetlifyCMS, DatoCMS or Contentful) compatible with this theme in a Netlify site.

(3rd Writing) After a couple of years, I ran a mass-update on the entire site and its content to account for development work from the template, security updates (both in the codebase and on the Infra side), and I now have a project to add in routing for a few more domains and edge functionality.

(4th writing) After another couple of years, I ran another mass-update on the entire site to account for changes in template development work, security updates, changes in infrastructure (TLDs Netlify uses, additional domains), changes in syntax (how to declare additional web headers), and to implement a working (!) Sveltia CMS to replace the now defunct Forestry and Netlify CMS systems. Edge functionality from Netlify or Cloudflare workers (including what exactly such functionality would accomplish) will be considered for a 5th iteration of this website in the future.

As the Hugo site builder and the 'coder' theme used are also openly licensed, please feel free to clone this git repository for your own use as well!

(I have always thought that the resume PDF directory is actually quite the good idea for a career website, for example.)

Open-source contributions, as with most things, are welcomed! Please make your own branch and submit requests when you have finished work to add to the site. (Partial work is accepted, so long as it will not break things. Full integrations or features are much appreciated!)
