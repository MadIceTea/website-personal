Alex is a governance, risk, and compliance analyst at Kong, and an experienced cyber security analyst growing into security engineering and architecture for on-prem and cloud systems.

He enjoys cats, the JPOP group Perfume, TensorFlow neural network projects, Thinkpads, almost any music, and family.

If he's not working on his day job or tinkering with one of his current projects (below), he often can be found studying for IT Certifications. (Or, simply resting!)

Currently, efforts are being focused on AWS Systems Administrator-type exams.

* A [mail server backend](https://github.com/MadIceTea/imap-mail-checker-server) and a [mail extension frontend](https://github.com/MadIceTea/imap-mail-checker-cx) for checking any IMAP connected inbox's new messages and notifying upon their arrival
* Coming Soon: "What's a Real "AI" Television Commercial?" via the _Inception v3_ Dataset

## Setup

This site was made with the static-website generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is built in [Go](http://golang.org/).

The ['coder' theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) was used to make this website, and various members from the ['Engineering Students' Discord server](https://discord.gg/EngineeringStudents) helped debug some early issues. They have since contributed to some of the site design, header debugging, and resume reviews. Many thanks to them all.

Currently, [Forestry CMS](https://app.forestry.io) is powering this website's page and post creation.
