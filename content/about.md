Alex enjoys cats, the JPOP group Perfume, TensorFlow neural network projects, Thinkpad computers, almost all music, and his family.

When he is not working  or tinkering with one of his current projects (below), he often can be found completing his master's homework, reading digital law, or simply watching slice-of-life anime, now that he has caught up on almost all the IT certifications he wants to obtain for a while (except the CISSP). 

He also has a few projects which he holds an interest in (although progress is very slow):

- A [mail server backend](https://github.com/MadIceTea/imap-mail-checker-server) and a [mail extension frontend](https://github.com/MadIceTea/imap-mail-checker-cx) for checking any IMAP connected inbox's new messages and notifying upon their arrival. (Alex does not use GMail for his personal mail, so he finds most extensions to be deficient in this ability.)
- An idea Alex has had: "What would a Real "AI" Television Commercial look like?" via the _Inception v3_ Dataset

His previous projects include:

- [Thesis research: Using Machine Learning to Predict Risk of Wildfire Damage](https://github.com/MadIceTea/FUWRM)
- [Land Image-Data Assessment: Tracking urban density via satellite imagery](https://github.com/madicetea/LIDA)
- An unreleased SUICA/PASMO (stored-value mass-transit card) Android Application
- Various assignments for a [Coursera series in Cybersecurity](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security).
- [A previous website and blog for the PEAK Student Council](https://github.com/PEAKStudentCouncil/website-prod)
- [Website for the Global Faculty Development Group](http://www.gfd.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/)

and contributions to:

- [QRM](https://github.com/MadIceTea/qrm2), to add Japanese and Netherland bandplan documents

## Setup

This site was made with the static-website generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is built in [Go](http://golang.org/). Additionally, [Sveltia content management system (CMS)](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/) was installed onto the site, in order to facilitate the quicker editing and publication of existing and soon-to-be published web pages and blog entries. (Previously, [Forestry CMS](https://app.forestry.io) had assisted in this website's page and post creation.)

The ['coder' theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) was used to make this website, and various members from the ['Engineering Students' Discord server](https://discord.gg/EngineeringStudents) helped debug some early issues. They have since contributed to some of the site design, header debugging, and resume reviews. Many thanks to them all.
