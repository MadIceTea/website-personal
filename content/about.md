Alex enjoys cats, the JPOP group Perfume, slice-of-life comedy anime, Thinkpad computers, almost all music, and his family. You can also learn more about his activities on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mrlogicalalex), connect on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/madicetea), and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/madicetea).

When he is not working or tinkering with one of his current digital or house DIY projects, he often can be found completing his master's homework, reading digital law, or walking around outside and discovering something new about wherever he is, now that he has caught up on almost all the IT certifications he wants to obtain for a while (except the CISSP).

## Setup

This site was made with the static-website generator [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which is built in [Go](http://golang.org/). Additionally, [Sveltia content management system (CMS)](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/) was installed onto the site, in order to facilitate the quicker editing and publication of existing and soon-to-be published web pages and blog entries. (Previously, a very clunky integration of [Forestry CMS](https://app.forestry.io) had assisted in this website's page and post creation.)

The ['coder' theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) was used to make this website, and various members from the 'Enginerds' Discord server helped debug some early issues. They have since contributed to some of the site design features, configurations debugging, and resume reviews. Many thanks to them all.
