## PIPELINE SECURITY

This blog post is to discuss some of the things that I did while I was employed with PIPELINE SECURITY (aka パイプラインセキュリティ).

In short, I was responsible for

* making an internal DNS server by spinning up new machines in Vultr
* Documentation, Documentation, Documentation
* Investigating getting listed by our email blacklist!
* giving a high-level pitch to potential customers at the JANOG44 trade show
* A bit of hardware provisioning magic
* ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) spinup & hosting
