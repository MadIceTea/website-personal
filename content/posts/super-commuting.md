## Super Commuting

How long does your commute to work take?

A super commuter will (by definition of the US Census) spend over 90 minutes in each direction to get to and from their place of work and their place of residence.

Many people commute to their workplace, instead of moving to be very close. Their reasons may vary, but it often is a mix of:

* staying near their family
* not interfering with their family's way of life (spouse's work, children's school)
* the high cost of living in the area of work, compared to their region of residence
* better economic opportunity / a limited job market in their own region of residence
* already being used to a lifestyle that requires moving around between regions on a regular basis

### So what about the author?

The author's reasons are not that different than the reasons listed above.
